This project consists in a machine learning model to predic whether patients have diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements. I used the "Pima Indians Diabetes" dataset, which consists of several independent variables and one target. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
