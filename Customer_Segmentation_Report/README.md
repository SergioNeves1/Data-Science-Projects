This is the repo in which I post my data science, machine learning and deep learning projects
# Projects :
 - Unsupervised Learning
  	- Analyzing demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population 
  	- Building an unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company
  	- The data that has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task
 - Supervised Learning
 	- Analyse demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and build a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company
 
 # About me :
 
 I am an electrical engineer turned data scientist who loves leveraging data-driven solutions that make an impact on business and society. My first encounter with data science occurred when I worked as a student researcher at the Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory (Fluminense Federal University) in which I built Artificial Neural Network models for power forecast.

Thereafter, I won a scholarship that allowed me to study at the University of Toronto in Canada. After this experience, I was given the opportunity to work with electrical projects and project management in a small company in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My third working contract involved tasks related to the project management of two electrical substation construction projects in a multinational company.

Right now, Iâ€™m currently working on projects related to machine learning and data science which includes  customer segmentation, recommendation system and marketing campaign response ( Identify potential customers)
